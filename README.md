# ZodiacSignCalculator

 For the Mastery Assignment I was supposed to create a fully functional simple application with a GUI. The application I made is a Zodiac Sign Calculator. The user enters a year in the text field and when they click the “Enter” button the application calculates the zodiac sign for that year and prints the message that identifies the zodiac sign for that year. The user is then prompted by two buttons, “Learn more” and “Enter another year”. By clicking the “Learn more” button, the user is taken to a new screen that displays a paragraph detailing some of the personality traits of a person born in that zodiac year. The “Enter another year” button appears on this screen as well. By clicking on the “Enter another year” button (on either screen), the user will be taken back to the original screen where they can enter another year.

I had wanted to incorporate an error warning, that when an invalid input (anything other than a year) is entered an error message would appear. I could not figure out how to create this error though, since the switch case statement uses integers and not strings. That is something to work on in order to improve my program.
